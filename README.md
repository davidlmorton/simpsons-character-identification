# Simpson Character Identification via Deep Learning

In this repo are some Jupyter notebooks that identify simpson characters using deep learning.
The notebooks are all using [pytorch-sconce](https://github.com/davidlmorton/pytorch-sconce).

## Google Colab

To get started running these notebooks in google colab, follow these steps:

  1. Clone this repo onto your local machine, or download the .zip archive.
  2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com and set up account (if needed).
  3. Choose to create a new notebook.
  4. From the `File` menu, choose `Upload notebook...` and choose a notebook from this repository.
  5. From the `Edit` menu, choose `Notebook settings` and under `Hardware Acceleration` choose `GPU` and then save.
  6. Run the notebook as normal (shift click).

## Getting the data

The data comes from this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset): alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset
